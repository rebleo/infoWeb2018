#### Course Description:
This 15-week course introduces students to the basics of web design and programming for the web. Students will work primarily with HTML and CSS to build the structural and visual components of a website, using CSS to integrate interaction and animation. In the second half of the semester, students will be introduced to other libraries for responsive design (Bootstrap) and languages (JavaScript) to create more complex, interactive websites.

---

#### Learning Outcomes:
Become conversant in web authoring technologies including CSS, HTML, and JavaScript
Create a unique media rich website considering key aspects of visual systems, interaction design and user experience
3. Create site maps and wireframes to map out project development
4. Debug broken code + know how to search for relevant information + code syntax online
5. Research and apply various APIs for web development
6. Research + incorporate contemporary JS libraries such as p5.js, Bootstrap.js or Three.js

#### Course Requirements:
Students are expected to participate in class: contributing positively to discussions, arriving on time having thoughtfully completed the reading, technical and creative assignments. Although students will need their laptops with them for every class, computers should be closed and mobile devices silent and not glowing during critique and class discussion. The mis-use of computational machines while in class will negatively affect your grade.

---

#### Method of Evaluation:
1. Class Participation (20% of grade): Please arrive to class on time. Please do the assigned readings and come to class prepared to share your reflections - active and informed discussion makes the course more interesting for everyone. Attendance to all classes is required and attendance is taken at each class.

2. Design + Technical Exercises (30% of grade) will be executed through the semester by following in class demonstrations, online tutorials and assigned readings. These exercises will be essential for learning markup and coding and to successfully complete more complex projects.

3. Midterm Project (25% of grade)

4. Final Project (25% of grade) 

Course Projects will be evaluated by three components equally: Creativity, Technical Breadth, Professional Presentation. Completed projects should reflect a sense of ambition and dedication toward realization.

#### Attendance:
 Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of each class.

This class meets for 1 hour and 15 minutes twice per week. Students are expected to come on time, because there is a lot of material to cover. Students who come in later than 20 minutes after the class started will be marked absent. If you know in advance that you will not be able to attend a class, email me beforehand and explain why.

* 3 unexcused latenesses = one absence.
* 3 unexcused absences = one half grade decrease (e.g. an A becomes an A-).
* More than 3 unexcused absences a student will receive a failing grade.
