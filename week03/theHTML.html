						<h2><a href="https://www.fordham.edu/info/20526/majors_and_minors/1884/new_media_and_digital_design" target="_blank"> New Media + Digital Design </a></h2>
						<p>You are in the midst of digital revolution. We are discovering new media and ways to communicate seemingly every day. As a new media and digital design major, youâ€™ll join the next generation of digital leaders in a new interdisciplinary program
							at Fordham. Our program combines the forces of multiple departments: communication and media studies, visual arts, English, computer and information science, and business. Youâ€™ll develop innovative technical capabilities. Youâ€™ll examine the new
							modes of information-gathering, collaboration, democratic participation, and self-expression. Youâ€™ll gain a deep social, historical, and ethical understanding of new media. And youâ€™ll graduate ready to skillfully navigate an ever-evolving media
							environment. But youâ€™ll learn more than new media and digital design here. Youâ€™ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the performing arts through Fordhamâ€™s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal
							arts education. We want you to excel in your fieldâ€”and as a human being.</p>
