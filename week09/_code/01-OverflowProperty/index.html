		<h1>The overflow-x Property</h1>
		<p>The overflow-x property specifies whether to clip the content, add a scroll bar, or display overflow content of a block-level element, when it overflows at the left and right edges.</p>

		<h2>overflow-x: scroll:</h2>
		<div class="theFirstExample">These then all of them have it in them that everything turns inside them to suspicion, to cleverness, to self-protection, to sexual emotion, to sensibility of a kind that is a thing that is called sentimental, before it comes to produce emotion from
			the thing about the thing in relation to the thing itself inside them.</div>

		<h2>overflow-x: hidden:</h2>
		<div class="theSecondExample"> There is one, I knew this one quite very well once and last week again I was seeing this one and now I am quite a good deal understanding this one, this is one and in this one everything was in this one sensibility of a sentimental kind, this was in
			this one not very much as suspicion as I was saying it is in some, and in this one every- thing, nothing had any meaning excepting as arousing a feeling of sen- timental sensibility that was the same thing whatever was the thing that came to this one
			as touching this one.</div>

		<h2>overflow-x: auto:</h2>
		<div class="theThirdExample"> This one was pretty completely to every one completely socially one and this is quite a common thing. Sometime a history of her and her. two mothers and her sister will be written and I have been telling that it will be written to several of them. She
			was as I was saying completely such a one and as a younger one was sharp and interesting and then she was a married one and then she was large and dull.</div>

		<h2>overflow-x: visible (default):</h2>
		<div class="theFourthExample">This was after she succeeded fairly at the be- ginning of her middle living in coming to be a married one. She had not then any reaction at all in living for she was then in her married living living with bottom being reacting and there was no bottom
			being in her, living, at all in her then and every one said it was such a surpris- ing thing that she should be then so completely a submissive and indif- ferent and inefficient and a little a timid one then when she had been before her being a married
			one so altogether an emotional and dark, expressive and clever one but it was just this thing that I am saying that I am now pretty well understanding that makes it a completely a natural thing, she had not ever had anything that did not turn to sensibility
			before it reached her in her and when she was a tired one and married and fatter then there was not this then.</div>
